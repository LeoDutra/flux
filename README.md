### 2D graphic Library for JavaScript and HTML5



#### Objective:
Create a very fast, easy and light engine, for "HTML5 Canvas".
<br />
#### So, why Flux:
There are great projects around HTML5, SVG, WebGL and some other new stuff. Some are doing a very nice work [https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js three.js] ([http://mrdoob.com Mr.Doob]) is one of them.

But most of these projects aim more than one of these technologies. Flux will focus only on HTML5 Canvas Element. Flux shall be a base for many other amazing projects.
<br />
#### More:

*Focus:*

+ physics: soft and rigid bodies, joints, fluids, collision and more (similar to Box2D)
+ lightweight and fast scene graph (rendering organization too)
+ scalable viewport
+ general graphic effects (blur, etc)
+ mouse events and panning
+ very fast and lightweight code
+ single (and closure-compiled)`.js` file

<br />
*Integration/suggestion:*
+ sound management
+ chat API ([http://ajaxim.com/ Ajax IM])
+ [http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/ WebSockets] ([http://nodejs.org/ Node.js])
+ easy UI creation for Canvas
+ useful formats for map, scenery and other stuff data
+ isometric engine (based on [http://code.google.com/p/as3isolib/ as3isolib]?)
+ pathfinding.
